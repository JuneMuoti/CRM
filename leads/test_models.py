# Each Test Method Tests One Thing
    # a unit test is a method that instantiates a small portion of our application and verifies its behavior independently from other parts.
    # Integration testing is when individual software modules are combined and tested as a group
    # , a single test should assert the behavior of a single view, model, form, method or function.
    # 

# Create your tests here.
