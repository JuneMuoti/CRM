As [Geoffrey Nzomo]() writes 

> The overriding design goal for DJ CRM
>  is to make it as easy to use
> as possible. The idea is that a
>CRM  should be very basic to use
> applying basic CRUD operataions, as well as appealing, without
> looking like a user has to be first educated on where to start.
